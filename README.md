# mealplancreator

python code that creates a meal plan that has perfect micro nutrition, price optimization, and specified macro nutrients


When dealing with large datasets, optimizing the code can significantly improve performance. Here are some optimizations you can implement for the given code:

Retrieve a batch of random recipes at once: Instead of executing a separate SQL query for each random recipe selection, you can fetch a batch of random recipes in a single query. This reduces the overhead of multiple round trips to the database.

Calculate nutritional content and budget incrementally: Rather than recalculating the total nutritional content and budget for each meal plan, you can maintain running totals as you generate the meal plan. This eliminates the need for nested loops and improves efficiency.

Use SQL aggregation for nutritional content and budget calculation: Utilize the power of SQL to perform aggregation operations directly in the database. This eliminates the need for looping and reduces data transfer between the database and Pytho
